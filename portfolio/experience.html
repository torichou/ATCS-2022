				<h3>Here I Stand, Innova Recordings</h3>
				<p>Recorded at Skywalker Studios, Here I Stand is the debut album of iSing Silicon Valley. The album features some of the stunning works commissioned by iSing during its first six seasons, with themes ranging from social justice to individual growth and collective power.</p>
				<p>The album includes <em>Never Shall I Forget</em>, Adam Schoenberg's haunting work with text from excerpts from Elie Wiesel's Holocaust memoir <em>Night</em>; <em>365</em>, a powerful stance on gun violence, and <em>In Your Light</em>, a glorious triumph by Daniel Elder.</p>
				<p>"The iSing singers are noteworthy for their strong voices, crisp and accurate in attack, smooth in blend, and clean in articulation. The voices are produced with clarity and focus, often with surprising depth; some of the altos sound positively tenorial." - Melinda Bargreen, EarRelevant</p>

				<h3>So Quietly, Innova Recordings</h3>
				<p>This single by Caroline Shaw, released in September 2021, is a student-conducted ten-part piece. Upon the Covid-19 pandemic, nine other singers and I rehearsed over video call and recorded each part individually, at home. </p>

				<h3>Drift, New Amsterdam Records</h3>
				<p>This single, by Daniel Wohl, is a blend of electronic and acoustic music that explores the vital role of breath and air in life–a response to the current events of the world. </p>
				<p>"The events of the past year, a silent, breath-defying virus, toxic air quality as California skies turned orange from record-breaking wildfires, relentless political turmoil that had us holding our breath, a choking police brutality crisis. These events have assaulted our understanding of what is normal, our humanness, our bodies, our loved ones, and the very life and breath we take for granted.” - Jennah Delp Somers, Director of iSing Silicon Valley
