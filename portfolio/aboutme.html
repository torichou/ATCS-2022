            <h3>I have been a singer and musician for as long as I can remember. I started learning to play the cello when I was five years old, and took piano lessons for many years. None of these instruments, however, captivated me as much as singing.</h3>
            <h3>I am now a choir member of iSing Silicon Valley, ranked 30th in the world. </h3>
