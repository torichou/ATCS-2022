                <h2>I'm Tori, and I have been a singer and musician for as long as I can remember. I started learning to play the cello when I was five years old, and took piano lessons for many years. None of these instruments, however, captivated me as much as singing.</h2>
                <h2>I am now a choir member of iSing Silicon Valley, ranked 30th in the world. With iSing, I perform in several concerts every year, work with and mentor younger singers, and travel the world. We are planning on competing in the World Choir Games in Korea 2023.</h2>
